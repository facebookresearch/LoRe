# LoRe: Personalizing LLMs via Low-Rank Reward Modeling

**[LoRe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14439)** is a lightweight, modular codebase for **learning personalized reward models** from preference data in multi-user environments. It supports both joint reward learning and few-shot personalization, and is built with extensibility in mind.

LoRe currently supports experiments on three benchmark datasets:
- **Reddit TLDR**: headline preference modeling
- **PRISM**: multi-turn dialogue response preferences
- **PersonalLLM**: user-personalized reward modeling for open-ended language model responses

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Low-rank reward model learning across users
- Few-shot personalization with new users
- Evaluation on seen/unseen users and prompts
- Modular dataset and optimizer configuration

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

LoRe requires Python 3.8+ and PyTorch. To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ”§ Core Components (`utils.py`)

The following functions are central to training and evaluating personalized reward models. You may want to modify these if youâ€™re extending LoRe:

### Model 
- `LoRe(...)`: Class modeling shared reward model `V` (linear transformation on fixed embeddings) and user-specific weights `W`
- `PersonalizeBatch(...)`: Class to model weights for new users

## Training and Evaluation
- `run(...)`: Runs the entire pipeline with 1. Learning the basis rewards, 2. Evaluation on seen users, 3. Fewshot learning on new users, 4. Evaluation on new users. The input K_list can be modified to specify the number of basis. 0 is the reference model, and 1 is the BT model.

## ðŸ§ª Usage Instructions

Below are instructions for each dataset folder, following a consistent workflow:
1. **Prepare the dataset** if required.
2. **Train the reward model basis** using joint learning.
3. **Evaluate few-shot personalization** with unseen users.

### ðŸ”¹ Reddit TLDR

Inside the `RedditTLDR/` directory:
- `prepare.py`: preprocesses the TLDR dataset
- `train_basis.py`: trains the shared reward model and user weights
- `vary_fewshot.py`: evaluates few-shot personalization performance

Example usage:
```bash
cd LoRe/RedditTLDR
python prepare.py          # only needed once
python train_basis.py
python vary_fewshot.py
```

---

### ðŸŸ£ PersonalLLM

Inside the `PersonalLLM/` directory:
- `prepare.py`: prepares model response data and user splits
- `train_basis.py`: learns reward basis across users
- `vary_fewshot.py`: evaluates few-shot generalization

Example usage:
```bash
cd LoRe/PersonalLLM
python prepare.py          # only needed once
python train_basis.py
python vary_fewshot.py
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ PRISM

Inside the `PRISM/` directory:
- `prepare.py`: prepares PRISM dialogue data and embeddings
- `train_basis.py`: runs reward model training and evaluation
- `vary_fewshot.py`: runs experiments varying the number of few-shot examples

Example usage:
```bash
cd LoRe/PRISM
python prepare.py          # only needed once
python train_basis.py
python vary_fewshot.py
```
